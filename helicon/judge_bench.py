"""Slice 1: benchmark Qwen as the memory-rot JUDGE against human-ruled ground truth.

The rot exam's contradiction judge (`helicon.qwen.detect_contradictions`) is
Qwen-powered and tier-swappable. This measures how well each Qwen tier judges
contradictions, and it is the keystone of the moonshot: the whole "Qwen is the
verification brain" claim rests on Qwen being a measurably good judge.

Ground truth = Oscar's OWN human rulings (compiled into GOLDEN_RULES): facts a
human settled, each with the true value AND the competing value that was ruled
wrong. That gives a clean labeled set with no selector in the loop:
  - a POSITIVE probe pairs the true value against the ruled-wrong value -> a real
    contradiction the judge SHOULD flag (measures recall).
  - a NEGATIVE probe pairs the true value against a consistent restatement of it
    -> NOT a contradiction, the judge should pass it (measures specificity).
The probe SENTENCES are minimal constructions of the ruled facts; the FACTS and
their verdicts are the human's, not invented. Real judge accuracy, no fabricated
numbers, cross-provider judges plug into the same harness in slice 3.

(An earlier design scored selector-produced pairs by file label; it conflated
file-label with pair-label and measured the selector, not the judge. Replaced.)
