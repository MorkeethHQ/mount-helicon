"""Cross-source contradiction pairing — the R1 selector.

ROT.md R1 said it out loud: the Qwen detector was proven on the real birthday
pair, but *production pairing across sources* was the gap — nothing selected
which two cubes to hand the detector, so the conflict only surfaced when a
human already knew where to look.

This closes the gap deterministically. From every live cube it extracts
(person, topic, interval) assertions — a person name and a calendar date (or
range) inside a small window around an event keyword ("birthday", "wedding",
...). Assertions group by (person, topic); a group where two different source
files assert two *disjoint* intervals is a candidate contradiction ("Sep
11-13" vs "Sep 13" overlap, so they agree; "Jul 13" vs "Jul 18" cannot both
be true). The selector finds, the Qwen judge (detect_contradictions) rules;
with no key the disjoint-interval mismatch itself is the verdict. Zero LLM
calls in the selector.

Findings land in audit_log as audit_type='factual' (same shape audit_factual
writes), so the dashboard FINDINGS feed, the graph's 'contradicts' edges and
the rot exam all pick them up with no new plumbing.
