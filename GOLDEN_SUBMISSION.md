# Mount Helicon — Golden Submission

**Track:** MemoryAgent · **What it is:** *a Qwen-powered governance layer for agent
memory* — a memory control plane, not another memory store.

Memory stores retain facts, but they do not reliably detect when a fact has gone
stale, conflicts with another source, or has been ruled false. **Helicon audits a
memory store, lets the machine handle routine rot, escalates only genuine
contradictions to a human, and turns each ruling into an enforceable rule — with a
receipt and a reversible undo.** Qwen is load-bearing: it judges logical
contradiction and grounding where similarity scores are insufficient. When evidence
is weak, Helicon reports **DEGRADED** and withholds routing rather than pretending
confidence.

Today Helicon ships the governed-memory loop: **audit → human ruling → verified
apply → enforced guard → undo.** It is the production-minded *govern* half of an
agent-memory system — a real, tested way to make an agent's memory safer, more
accountable, and harder to silently corrupt. It is **not** yet a complete "memory
OS," and this document does not pretend it is.

## First run (exact, no credentials, no personal data)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MorkeethHQ/mount-helicon.git
cd mount-helicon
pip install -e .
helicon demo            # seeds a labelled demo store + opens the dashboard
# open http://127.0.0.1:8420
```

**Fresh-clone verification:** `bash scripts/judge-check.sh` (clone → install → boot →
populated, no personal-data leak) · `python3 -m pytest -q` (393 passing). Localhost-
bound, keyless, scans nothing on your machine.

## The demo (under 3 minutes — the governance loop)

1. **0:00–0:15 — native entry.** Open Mount Helicon from its macOS menu-bar icon.
   *"Memory stores remember; Helicon checks whether what they remember is still true."*
2. **0:15–0:40 — a dangerous contradiction.** The seeded store holds
   "Stripe is in test mode — safe to run a checkout" (March) and "we went live on
   Stripe July 1 — every charge is real money" (July). Believe the stale one and an
   agent **charges real customers by mistake.**
3. **0:40–1:15 — full terminal loop.** Run `helicon heal --demo --reset`, then
   `helicon heal --demo --apply`. The deterministic exam measures 12 rot classes,
   applies routine repairs, and leaves human truth decisions visible.
4. **1:15–1:35 — Qwen's verdict.** A live Model Studio call returns
   **CONTRADICTION**. Similarity scores cannot make that logical judgment.
5. **1:35–2:05 — one tap → applied → receipt.** The human taps the current answer
   ("live — real money"); it applies instantly — compiled into GOLDEN_RULES; the
   receipt proves it landed and is enforced (*recorded · in GOLDEN_RULES · guard now
   enforces it*), with Undo. One action, not a staging ceremony.
6. **2:05–2:20 — the guard enforces it.** Show the guard **blocking** "Stripe is in
   test mode, safe to run a checkout" before an agent can act on it — the exact
   mistake that would have charged real cards.
7. **2:20–2:38 — honest report.** `helicon report --llm` reports **DEGRADED**,
   grounding **0.385**, and one broken task on the full store.
8. **2:38–2:50 — running on Alibaba Cloud.** Show
   `curl -s http://47.237.3.97:8420/api/health` returning `status: ok` from the live
   **Alibaba Cloud ECS** backend in Singapore.

That is the whole proof in under three minutes.

## Live Qwen API proof (load-bearing)

```
$ python3 -c "from helicon.qwen import get_client, complete; from helicon.config import load_config; \
    print(complete(get_client(load_config()), 'Reply CONTRADICTION or CONSISTENT only.', \
    'A: Stripe is in test mode, charges are simulated. B: we went live on Stripe, every charge is real money.', model='qwen3.6-flash'))"
CONTRADICTION            # qwen3.6-flash on Alibaba Model Studio, ~4s
```

## Proof of Alibaba Cloud

The rule (verbatim): *"You must demonstrate that the backend is running on Alibaba
Cloud"* and *"Proof must be a link to a code file in their code repo that
demonstrates use of Alibaba Cloud services and APIs."* Helicon meets both.

- **The backend is deployed and running on Alibaba Cloud ECS — a live public URL:**
  **http://47.237.3.97:8420** (region **Singapore / ap-southeast-1**). Verified live:
  `GET /api/health` → `{"status":"ok",...}`, `GET /` → HTTP 200.
  It serves the seeded **demo** store (no personal data). Reproducible on any Linux
  host with [`scripts/cloudshell-run.sh`](scripts/cloudshell-run.sh) (local-first: the
  same backend runs on the judge's machine, Cloud Shell, or an ECS box).
- **The load-bearing intelligence runs on Alibaba Cloud on every request.** Every
  contradiction/grounding judgment executes on Alibaba **Model Studio**
  ([`helicon/qwen.py`](helicon/qwen.py)); every embedding on Alibaba **DashScope**
  `text-embedding-v4` ([`helicon/embeddings.py`](helicon/embeddings.py)). Proven
  live (the call above). Kill the Alibaba side and the judging layer goes dark.
- **Also container-deployable to Function Compute** ([`fc/s.yaml`](fc/s.yaml) +
  [`fc/Dockerfile`](fc/Dockerfile)).

## What ships today vs. what is roadmap (strict)

**Ships today — the governed-memory loop (real, tested):** one-command safe seeded
demo; machine-review lane that auto-manages routine rot (ungrounded/stale/mechanical
never ask a human); a human exception queue; **one-tap ruling → applied instantly →
receipt with a verified probe → undo** (one action per exception, no staging
ceremony); compiled law + a guard that **blocks a ruled-wrong claim**;
live Qwen contradiction/grounding judging with an honest DEGRADED; routing withheld
below a quality floor. Failures never masquerade as success (audited + tested).

**Also included — a tested TaskRun/ContextPacket recorder** (read-only, local-only):
it preserves objective, frozen candidate context, artifact, and an **attested**
outcome (operator-attached — Helicon records it, does not run the test). It has
default-deny privacy and provably does not contaminate retrieval/utility/regret
data. **It does not yet drive retrieval, routing, or learning** — it is a provenance
recorder, the beginning of the left side of the loop, not an agent-facing workflow.

**Roadmap (not claimed as working):** a read-only MCP retrieve path ("ask Helicon
what is safe to believe" before an agent answers); decision-time context injection
(so the packet is proven *received*, not just candidate); evidence-backed context
recommendations; and only much later, policy-approved automatic remediation/routing.

## Product sequence

| Horizon | Product |
|---|---|
| **Now** | Memory governance: detect → rule → enforce → undo |
| **Next** | Memory flight recorder: task → context → artifact → attested outcome |
| **Then** | Evidence-backed context recommendations (read-only MCP) |
| **Later** | Policy-approved automatic remediation and routing |

## Red-team self-verdict

**The thesis is governance, and governance is enough.** A skeptical judge sees a
real, tested loop — a memory store's contradiction caught by Qwen, ruled once by a
human, compiled into an enforceable rule, blocked by the guard, and reversible —
with nothing faked and failures that never masquerade as success.

**The one real risk is claim drift**, not missing features: calling it an "OS that
learns" while the strongest proof is *governance*. We have cut that language. Helicon
is the governance and evaluation layer for agent memory. The learn-half exists only
as a tested, honestly-labelled recorder.

**Where we are still exposed:** (1) the recorder is provenance, not causal evidence,
and we say so; (2) verification is operator-**attested**, not Helicon-run — the label
stays rigorous. (The Alibaba-deployment question is settled: the backend is live on
Alibaba Cloud ECS at http://47.237.3.97:8420, verified reachable.)

The insight the whole product is built around: **agent memory becomes dangerous not
when it forgets, but when it confidently preserves something that should no longer be
believed.** Helicon exists to prevent that.
