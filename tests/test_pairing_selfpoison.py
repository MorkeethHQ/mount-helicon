"""#361: the ruling loop poisoned itself.

Recording a ruling manufactured the evidence that the ruling had been violated.
`resolve --list` showed "Itai wedding: 08-14..08-22 vs 09-11..09-13" as a LIVE
critical contradiction — a fact ruled on Jul 11 (#322) and already compiled into
GOLDEN_RULES. The source of the "wrong" side was the correction itself:

    #322 Itai wedding = **09-11..09-13** (the "Aug 14-22" cube was mislabeled)

Two independent faults, both proven live before these tests were written:

1. The parser could not read `09-11..09-13`, which is HELICON'S OWN canonical
   interval label (_iv_label) — the format every ruling, resolution and
   GOLDEN_RULE is written in. Resolutions are parsed by _parse_label, which
   understands `..`; cube content was parsed only by the prose patterns. Two
   parsers, two grammars, one format. So the line asserted ONLY the dead value
   it quoted, and never the truth it stated.

2. The never-twice guard re-alarms on any post-resolution cube asserting the
   dead value. The memory that RECORDS a ruling is written moments after it and
   must name the dead value to say what was wrong. So every ruling planted a
   future false alarm, inflating R1 forever and discrediting the one exam that
   has to stay trustworthy.

The guard itself must survive: real rot coming back MUST still re-alarm. That is
what test_the_never_twice_guard_still_fires_on_real_rot exists to prove.
